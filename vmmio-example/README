  Simplest vMMIO example
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Build the library and test programs with `make'.

  * you could use a Raspberry Pi VM to build this and run the outside program

2. Create a Raspberry Pi virtual machine with vMMIO:

  * vMMIO at address 0xfef00000, size 0x1000
  * vMMIO interrupt 80

3. Start the Raspberry Pi VM, and copy `vmmio-test-inside` into it.

  * this is the test program that accesses vMMIO from inside the VM
  * it takes no arguments, you just run it

4. Run `sudo ./vmmio-test-inside' in the vM. It should produce the following
   results:

 0: 0xaa
 1: 0xaa
 2: 0xaa
 3: 0xaa
 4: 0xaa

5. Start the vmmio-test-outside program outside the VM, and give it the
   VM's service IP and vMMIO port to connect to:

  * ./vmmio-test-outside 10.10.0.1:4444

6. Run `sudo ./vmmio-test-inside' in the VM again. It should produce
   a different set of results:

 0: 0x00
 1: 0x01
 2: 0x02
 3: 0x03

7. The vmmio-test-outside program should also print a bunch of requests that
   it has responded to.

8. Done.
